# 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains my solutions for the tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings for the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Task 0: Reset to 98

In this task, I've implemented a C function `reset_to_98` that takes a pointer to an integer and updates the value it points to, setting it to 98.

### Compilation

To compile the test program for this task, you can use the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-reset_to_98.c -o 0-98

## Task 1: Swap Integers

In this task, I've implemented a C function `swap_int` that takes two pointers to integers as parameters and swaps the values of the integers they point to.

### Compilation

To compile the test program for this task, you can use the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-main.c 1-swap
