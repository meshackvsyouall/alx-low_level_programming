# 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains my solutions for the tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings for the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Task 0: Reset to 98

In this task, I've implemented a C function `reset_to_98` that takes a pointer to an integer and updates the value it points to, setting it to 98.

## Task 1: Swap Integers

In this task, I've implemented a C function `swap_int` that takes two pointers to integers as parameters and swaps the values of the integers they point to.

## Task 2: String Length

In this task, I've implemented a C function `_strlen` that takes a pointer to a string as a parameter and returns the length of the string.

## Task 3: Print a String

In this task, I've implemented a C function `_puts` that takes a pointer to a string as a parameter and prints the string followed by a new line to the standard output.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear ###

Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes ###

Write a function that reverses a string.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true ###

Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half ###

Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers ###

Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### 9. strcpy ###

Write a function that copies a string.

### 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers ###

Write a function that converts a string to an integer.

### 100. Nature abhors a vacuum ###

Write a program that generates random valid passwords for the `101-crackme` program.
